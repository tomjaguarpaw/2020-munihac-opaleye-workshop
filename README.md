# Opaleye workshop &ndash; Munihac 2020

## When is the workshop?

Saturday, September 12th at 15:00â€“18:00 CEST.  See [the Munihac
website](https://munihac.de/2020.html) for any announcements of last
minute updates.

## Prerequisites

* To get the most out of this workshop you should be familiar with at
least intermediate-level Haskell, including "do" notation.

* If you want to follow along by writing your own code examples you
should know how to clone a Haskell git repository and build it with
Cabal (or other build tool of your choice).

* If you want to *run* your own code examples you should have an
installation of Postgres available.  The tutorial will use
[tmp-postgres](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tmp-postgres-1.34.1.0)
to ensure it does not interfere with any other Postgres database you
may have.

* Familiarity with the list monad would be particularly helpful for
understanding Opaleye's semantics.  Familiarity with SQL will also be
useful.

## What will the workshop involve?

* We will work through some of the examples on
  <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>.

* I will answer anyone's questions about Opaleye and we will discuss
  anything about Opaleye that attendees would like to discuss.
  Suggested topics for questions and discussion include

  * Implementation/internals
  * Denotational semantics
  * Testing strategy (property testing)
  * How
    [`Default`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/product-profunctors-0.11.0.0/docs/Data-Profunctor-Product-Default.html)/[product-profunctors](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/product-profunctors) work
  * Philosophy

## What's next?

More details will be announced here before the talk, probably by
Friday, September 11th.
