# Opaleye workshop &ndash; Munihac 2020

## When is the workshop?

Saturday, September 12th at 15:00â€“18:00 CEST.  See [the Munihac
website](https://munihac.de/2020.html) for any announcements of last
minute updates.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop you should be familiar with at
least intermediate-level Haskell, including "do" notation.  If you
want to follow along by writing your own code examples you should know
how to clone a Haskell git repository and build it with Cabal (or
other build tool of your choice).  Familiarity with the list monad
would be particularly helpful for understanding Opaleye's semantics.
Familiarity with SQL will also be useful.

## What's next?

More details will be announced here before the talk, probably by
Friday, September 11th.
